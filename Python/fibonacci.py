# A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8....

# The first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.This means to say the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term.


# Python program to display the Fibonacci sequence

    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return recur_fibo(n - 1) + recur_fibo(n - 2)

# check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
    print("Plese enter a positive integer")
